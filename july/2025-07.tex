\section{July 2025 Research Summary}

\subsection{Galene-Simulator Comparison for 2D Nanowire Structures}
Comprehensive comparison between Galene and our simulator for 2D nanowire structures.

First, I expanded the current Galene code in our simulator. It is now a comprehensive Galene converter which can convert Galene simulation results (.OSV files and .GEO files) into other formats as required, such as MATLAB or for TikZ plots.

For comparison, I present the electron density and potential at a surface plot and at a slice here. The device structure we simulated is a double gate MOS structure, serving as the starting point to study the nanowire MOSFET. Here we use voltages for both gates $V_{gt}$ and $V_{gb}$ of 1.0 V and also a drain voltage $V_d$ of 1.0 V, with velocity saturation neglected (the saturation velocity in Galene is set to $10^{20}$ cm/s while velocity saturation in our simulator is turned off).

Device parameters: length $L = 150$ nm, width = 30 nm, gate length $L_g = 80$ nm, doping regions $L_{dop} = 35$ nm, with doping concentrations $N_{d1} = 10^{20}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $N_{d2} = 10^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$. Oxide thickness $d_{ox} = 2$ nm.}

    \label{fig:comparison}
\end{figure}

From the simulation results, it can be seen that the potential and electron density are in good agreement between Galene and our simulator. For the potential difference, it is mainly due to how the simulator handles the region outside the solution domain. As for the carrier density, the deviation is mainly at the doping transition region, which is expected due to different doping mapping approaches used by both simulators.

Here, a comparison of the potential and electron density at a cross-sectional slice is shown. This represents the profile along the surface at y=0.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Figs/pot_x_cut.pdf}
        \caption{Potential density slice comparison}
        \label{fig:potential_slice}
    \end{subfigure}
    \hfill
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.48\textwidth}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Cross-sectional comparison between Galene and our simulator along the y=0 surface.}
    \label{fig:slice_comparison}
\end{figure}


Up to this point, the grid spacing is set to 1 nm for both simulators. Figure~\ref{fig:refined_comparison} shows that after using a refined grid (0.5 nm) in Galene, the deviation regarding the electron density is reduced.
\textbf{Note:} The doping profile mapping into Galene is still under investigation. Our simulator uses a node (vertex) centered doping mapping, while it remains to be confirmed whether Galene uses the same approach or an element-centered mapping.

\subsection{Vertical FET Structure with Perforated Source}
 The current workaround is to use a partially doped active layer with ohmic contact as a substitute for the Schottky contact. This approach allows us to proceed with simulations while we work on integrating the Schottky contact feature into our simulator.

\subsection{Schottky Contact Implementation}
The current version of our simulator does not support Schottky contacts. To simulate the devices like RFET or VFET, the implementation of Schottky contact is necessary.
For the current ohmic contact, we have charge neutrality $n_0-p_0 = N_D - N_A$ and equilibrium assumed, which for Boltzmann statistics gives:
$\phi = V_k + \frac{kT}{q} asinh \left( \frac{(N_D - N_A)}{2 n^2_{i,eff}} \right)$

in the Schottky contact case,
$\phi = V_k - \phi_B + \frac{kT}{q} \ln \left( \frac{N_C}{n_{i,eff}} \right)$
is used.

Another aspect to consider is the different type of BC, instead of the Dirchlet BC, here a Robin (mixed) BC is used, which gives:
$J_n (vector) \cdot n(vector) = q v_n (n-n^B_0)$
$j_P$ Here
with
$n^B_0 = N_c exp(-qphi_B/kT)$
and $p^B_0 = N_v exp(-qphi_B/kT)$

where phi_B is the barrier height (the difference between the contact workfunction and the electron affinity of the semiconductor). v_n and v_p are the thermoionic emission velocities for electrons and holes, respectively n0B and p0B are the equilibrium densities.
